* uiua-ts-mode

This is a treesitter-powered emacs mode for [[https://www.uiua.org][Uiua]], an array language.

Much like the language itself, this mode is currently in progress.

Please report any divergence from the major/minor releases of uiua
as Github issues. They are considered bugs.

** Setup

This mode builds on [[https://github.com/crmsnbleyd/uiua-mode][uiua-mode]], which you can use if you have an older
Emacs version.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package uiua-ts-mode
    :mode "\\.ua\\'"
    :ensure t)  ; or :straight t if using straight.el
#+end_src
Upon loading a .ua file, emacs will complain about not finding the grammar.
Simply type ~M-x treesit-install-language-grammar~ then ~uiua~ to install it.
